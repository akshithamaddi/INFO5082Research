# Analysis of Census Income data using Machine-learning analysis
## Introduction
<sub> Every nation around the world face imbalance between the wealth and income. United States is one among those nations. One of the best solutions to maintain economic imbalance is by eradicating poverty in nations. This helps the nations to develop and improvise the economic imbalance. It is important for all the countries to find a best and optimal solution to control this problem. The main aim of this project is not only to make the poor substantial but also identify the predominant features essential to improve one’s income. To address the economical imbalance, machine learning and data mining techniques are performed on UCI adult dataset. This project addresses the global problem and provides optimal solutions by performing the following the analysis on the data set: data cleaning, Explanatory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Development, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data visualization. This proposed project, helps me to implement all the necessary analysis discussed above that are required for a successful completion of data science project and helps find a solution for global problem. Hence, this project is a best fit for me to finish my study in data science. I want to learn more about ANOVA, Machine Learning algorithms and Data Visualizations using tableau. The initial phase of the project includes Data Collection, Data Cleaning and Explanatory Data Analysis. In the second phase, hypothesis are developed, data visualization using tableau and machine learning models are performed. The literature section below discuses about the existing state of the artwork that is comparable to the study of research suggested in the paper. </sub>
## Statement of Problem
<sub> The UCI Adult dataset is used to eradicate the imbalance between wealth and income. This is done by performing classification on a set of attributes to anticipate if an individual’s annual income in the United States fits into the income segments of greater than 50k Dollars or less than or equal to 50k Dollars. It also helps us determine the features or attributes that makes a person to have earn less by developing few hypothesis. These features can be used as areas to improvement by the government to address the global problem.   This study applies all the phases (data collection, data preparation, Explanatory Data Analysis, Modeling, Machine learning models, Model Evaluation and interpreting the results) of a data science project to obtain the results for the described research question. The research aims to find a solution for a global problem faced by many nations’ government.  </sub>
