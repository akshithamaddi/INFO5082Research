# Analysis of Census Income data using Machine-learning analysis
## Introduction
<font size="1">Every nation around the world face imbalance between the wealth and income. United States is one among those nations. One of the best solutions to maintain economic imbalance is by eradicating poverty in nations. This helps the nations to develop and improvise the economic imbalance. It is important for all the countries to find a best and optimal solution to control this problem. The main aim of this project is not only to make the poor substantial but also identify the predominant features essential to improve oneâ€™s income. To address the economical imbalance, machine learning and data mining techniques are performed on UCI adult dataset. This project addresses the global problem and provides optimal solutions by performing the following the analysis on the data set: data cleaning, Explanatory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Development, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data visualization. This proposed project, helps me to implement all the necessary analysis discussed above that are required for a successful completion of data science project and helps find a solution for global problem. Hence, this project is a best fit for me to finish my study in data science. I want to learn more about ANOVA, Machine Learning algorithms and Data Visualizations using tableau. The initial phase of the project includes Data Collection, Data Cleaning and Explanatory Data Analysis. In the second phase, hypothesis are developed, data visualization using tableau and machine learning models are performed. The literature section below discuses about the existing state of the artwork that is comparable to the study of research suggested in the paper. </font>
